Today, megatrends have transcended us into a new era. With these rapid changes, humanity now finds itself at an inflection point, as we face unprecedented demographic pressure exacerbated by income disparity between the haves and have-nots. Essentially, in a world that is leaping forward like never before, there are many that are being left behind.

In the same vein, this era is also one of great possibilities, where we have the capacity to evolve our thoughts and actions to shape our destinies in a completely new way. All it would take is for us to leverage on the paradigm shifting ideas, wealth and capabilities available to us to begin changing the world for the better. However, while these may equip us to take action, it’s our humanity that will help navigate us towards a brighter, more inclusive, more sustainable future.

This brings us to the central theme of this year’s International Social Well-Being Conference (ISWC)- Shaping Destiny: Between Hope & Extinction. It’s a clarion call for us – as individuals, businesses, civil society, policymakers and governments – to take the future into our hands by emphasising the importance of inspiring and empowering people to fundamentally review, rethink and reshape their perspective towards well-being and human values, thus identifying new ways on how to live a quality life.
