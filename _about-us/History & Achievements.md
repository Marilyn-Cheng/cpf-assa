## History - A Peek at Our Past

### The Proposal (September, 1995)
The proposal to form an association, to be known as the ASEAN Social Security Association or ASSA, was put forward by the Indonesian National Social Security Association sometime in September 1995. The rationale for the proposal was to establish a regional body representing all social security organisations of ASEAN member countries. In view of the similarity of the objectives, programmes and activities of ASEAN social security organisations, ASSA would provide a forum for senior officials to meet regularly. Through the establishment of the ASSA, meaningful regional co-operation is fostered among the social security organisations, especially in the area of training, research and development.

### Meeting in Bali, Indonesia (November 13 - 19, 1995)
During the 25th International Social Security Association General Assembly held in Bali, Indonesia, from November 13 - 19, 1995, Prof. Dr. Awaloedin Djamin (Indonesian National Social Security Association), Tan Sri Sallehuddin bin Mohamed (Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia), Mr Chamlong Sriprasart (Social Security Office, Thailand) and Mr Renato C. Valencia (Social Security System, Philippines) mutually agreed in principle to the establishment of the ASEAN Social Security Association (ASSA). During the meeting, Prof. Dr. Awaloedin Djamin expressed the need for a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to formalize the establishment of ASSA.

### Meeting in Manila, Philippines (July 23, 1996)
On July 23, 1996, the heads of the social security institutions from the ASEAN region gathered at a special meeting held in Manila, Philippines, to discuss the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which was drafted by the Indonesian National Social Security Association. At the meeting, it was decided that more time was needed to study the draft MOA, and for each institution to prepare their comments and suggestions. It was also decided that the signing ceremony of the MOA was to be hosted by the Social Security Office in Thailand.

## Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand (February 13, 1998)
On February 13, 1998, a meeting was held at the Social Security Office in Bangkok, Thailand, between top officials of ASEAN social security organisations; namely, Prof. Dr. Awaloedin Djamin (President, Indonesian National Social Security Association), Tan Sri Sallehuddin bin Mohamed (Executive Chairman, Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia), Mr Wan Abdul Wahab Abdullah (Director-General, Social Security Organisation, Malaysia), Mr Leong Lick Tien (Deputy General Manager, Central Provident Fund Board, Singapore) and Mr Chamlong Sriprasart (Secretary-General, Social Security Office, Thailand). During the meeting which preceded the ASSA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signing ceremony scheduled for later in the day, they discussed and agreed that:
* The First Chairman of ASSA would come from Indonesia;
* The 2nd ASSA Meeting was to be held in September, 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;
* Tan Sri Sallehuddin bin Mohamed of the Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia, be elected as the Vice-Chairman of ASSA, and would assume the Chairmanship of ASSA in September, 1998;
* The appointment of the Secretary General was the prerogative of the Chairman;
* Laos and Vietnam would attend the MOA signing ceremony as witnesses, being not yet ready to become members of ASSA; and
* The ASSA logo design proposed by Thailand was accepted, with minor modifications.

### Signing Ceremony of ASSA MOA, Bangkok, Thailand (February 13, 1998)
On February 13, 1998, in Bangkok, Thailand, the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) establishing the ASEAN Social Security Association (ASSA) was formally signed by the heads of the social security organisations: Prof. Dr. Awaloedin Djamin (Indonesian National Social Security Association), Tan Sri Sallehuddin bin Mohamed (Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia), Mr Wan Abdul Wahab Abdullah (Social Security Organisation, Malaysia), Mr Renato C. Valencia (Social Security System, Philippines), Mr Cesar N. Sarino (Government Service Insurance System, Philippines), Mr Leong Lick Tien (Central Provident Fund Board, Singapore) and Mr Chamlong Sriprasart (Social Security Office, Thailand). The signing ceremony was witnessed by the Minister of Labor and Social Security of Thailand. Representatives from Lao PDR and Vietnam also attended the signing ceremony as observers.

The signing of MOA marked the birth of ASSA as the premier Social Security Association for regional co-operation in the ASEAN region.

## Achievements
In 1995, the heads of several social security institutions in ASEAN took the first bold step of putting their minds together, with the aim of maximising all efforts towards the achievement of progressive and sustainable social security protection within the region. The launch of the ASSA website in September 2000 marked another milestone that would foster greater and closer exchange of experiences and promote mutual co-operation among ASSA member countries and institutions. Today, ASSA continues to move with even greater strides and higher aspirations.
